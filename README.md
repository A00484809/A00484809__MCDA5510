Hi, my name is Kedar Gaikwad. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from India and have 1.3 years of experience as a Data Analyst at Media.net, where I worked on the LeadGen product. Collaborating with various stakeholders during this time gave me a clear vision of my future career path—I aim to become a Product Manager or Product Analyst.

I have a keen interest in watches, perfumes, and esports gaming, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge in various technologies, with a current focus on Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Project Management Tools, and Agile Development.

A fun fact about me is that I’ve successfully built three YouTube channels, each with over 50k subscribers. My active channel has 27,000 subscribers, where I create content to guide aspiring data analysts in their careers.

Feel free to reach me at Kedar.gaikwad@smu.ca.
